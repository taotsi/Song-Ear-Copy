## about this song

it's from a game DLC. The game is **Europa Universalis IV** presented by Paradox, and the DLC has the same as the song's name. At first glance I thought this song is related to the book *Guns, Germs and Steel* by Jared Diamond, about which I'm not sure now. The game is good but I'm not good at it. I just love the book, and of course metal as well. 

By the way, I finally got the guitar on the album cover of this DLC's soundtrack. It's a Schecter Hell Raiser I believe. The cover is super cool, with a skull, a tablature and this guitar on it. It's super Baroque and metal. It's a pity that this is not a neoclassical or symphonic metal song. Hope Waldetoft would write one someday.
