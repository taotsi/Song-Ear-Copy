by **Maga & Tudoran**, it's in minor mode, but sounds happy.

I once listened to this song as the bgm of a vedio. There's a very cute girl in the vedio. I've forgotten the girl for long. Just now I found this chord progression on a wrinkled paper. It's not a very listenable song, but I like the first part.
